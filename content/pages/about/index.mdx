<h5>Hi - I'm Carissa!</h5>
<p>
  My favourite thing to do by far is to <b>CREATE</b>! From making music to
  building web applications, I love finding new ways to integrate my creativity
  into projects I am working on. I also love to <b>LEARN</b>! You can always
  find me reading about recent tech advancements or picking up a new coding
  language.

    <h5>Experiences</h5>
    Communications Intern @Qoom. Social Media Coordinator @St. Robert’s Art Council. Marketing
    Executive @Project Bawaajigan.
    I create visual posts, newsletters, blogs, and videos using Markdown/HTML/CSS, Canva, and 
    iMovie. Creating media content has allowed me to combine my interests in design and marketing. 
    Seeing how to make effective and appealing designs for a target audience has brought me insight
    on UI design for my web projects.

    <h6 style="text-align: center; min-width: 200px;">Creative Arts</h6>
    Training in ballet the last 12 years of my life has taught me how to be perseverant, 
    a good team member, and to be confident. I have also picked up the piano, flute and 
    violin over the years, and love having spontaneous guitar jam sessions. Being able 
    to nurture my creativity and have an expressive outlet has enhanced my thinking and 
    communication abilities today. Check out my cover of Memories by Maroon 5!

  <h6 style="text-align: center; min-width: 200px;">Social Initiatives</h6> 
  In Oct 2020, I co-founded an Indigenous non-profit organization called Project 
  Bawaajigan that aims to educate the public and empower the native community. 
  Leading weekly meetings and overseeing all department operations has helped me 
  develop my leadership, communication and delegatory skills.

  <h6 style="text-align: center; min-width: 200px;">Teaching</h6> 
    As an avid learner, I strive to share my knowledge in mathematics and languages 
    with others. From working in youth summer camps and community programs to 
    privately tutoring children, I love seeing my students grow. Teaching has also 
    taught me how to be patient, attentive, and a leader — skills which have enabled
    me to become a leader to my own peers.
